## Abstract
Meme coins are a type of cryptocurrency that gained popularity on social media in the last few years. Social media might have an effect on the predictability of the price fluctuations of these coins, which is why this thesis tries to answer the following research question: does the sentiment of tweets improve the predictive ability of LSTMâ€“RNNs and FBProphet models on forecasting the price fluctuation of meme coins? Research has already been conducted where the prices of cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, were predicted using both of these models. However, little research was found on the prediction of price fluctuations of meme coins, which is why this thesis tries to minimize the gap in this field of research. The historical data from four coins, namely DOGE, SHIBA, MONA and Terra LUNA, were extracted and their corresponding tweets were scraped from Twitter. This data was then used as input to two artificial intelligence models: an LSTM-RNN and an FBProphet model. From the results can be concluded that the predictability of the price fluctuation of meme coins did not improve for both of the
used models with sentiment analysis.
